1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
* 
'hello'
-87.8
- 
/ 
  + 
6 

Solution:-

*,-,/,+ ->these are expression
'hello',-87.8,6 ->these are values



2.What is the difference between string and variable?
Solution:-
The difference between string and varibale are:
                    
> string is a data type where a variable is a name which can holds some values of any data type.
> always a string can be enclose within single inverted or double inverted("",'').
> when we assign a variable it have some values followed by assignment operator i.e (=).
> a variable is of any data type.

3. Describe three different data types.
Solution:-The 3 data types are integer,float,string.
Integer:-It is whole number.
         It can either positive or negative.
         Ex:x=6,y=8
         
Float:-This data type is used to store positive or negative number with a decimal point.
     Ex:a=23.45,b=65.6,c=-78.95

String:-This represents a sequence of character.
        Always a string is enclose in single inverted or double inverted.
        Ex:a="hi",b="hello"

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
Solution:-An expression is a combination of operators and operands that is interpreted to produce some other value.
Ex:a+b=c
here a and b are the operands and + is the operands.
Every expression produces some other values like,
a=3
b=5
c=a+b     # this is an expression
print(c)   # here we get the result of the expression

5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
Solution:-A statement is a complete line of code that performs some action,while an expression is any section of the code that evaluates to a value.

x = 1   #this is an assignment statement.
y = 6   #this is an assignment statement.

a = x + y   #this is an expression

6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
Solution:-
The output becomes 23 because initially the bacon is assign to the value 22 and after that it will be increment to 1 so it becomes 23.

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam' 
'spam' * 3

Solution"-
In first case, it will be cocatenate.We know that 2 or more strings can concatenate with each other and after
that it will produce a result of combination of these strings.
In second case,it will multiply to 3 with the following string.

In first case the result will be:- spamspamspam
In second case the result will be:- spamspamsapm

The output of the following code will be same.

8.Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
Solution:-

eggs is valid variable name because a variable name starts with alphabet while 100 is not a valid variable name because a variable name is not start with the digits.

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?
Solution:-

For interger-> int()
For floating-point number->float()
For string->str()

10.Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
Solution:-

This expression cause an error because we can't concatenate string with integer.
We fix it by:
    We have make the integer to string like
    'I have eaten ' + '99' + ' burritos.'
